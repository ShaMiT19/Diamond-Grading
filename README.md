Diamond Grading

Diamond clarity refers to the absence of tiny, natural in-
clusions (imperfections) inside a diamond or on its surface.
Almost all diamonds contain their own unique inclusions due
to their natural formation process.

The 4Cs have long been the accepted standard for grading
the rarity and value of diamonds. Yet diamond grading is
an imprecise art, subject to the natural inconsistencies of
the human eye when observing extremely fine differences in
diamond color, and the location and appearance of inclusions,
which form the basis for the clarity grade.

This report gives an assessment of diamond clarity with a
plotted clarity diagram drawn by the appraiser. Significant
clarity characteristics present in the diamond that influence
the quality are shown in the plotted diagram, such as feather,
needle and pinpoint inclusion. However, inclusions of the same
type can come in thousands of shapes and sizes and have
wide-ranging transparency levels. Their appearance under the
same light source can also be different. Therefore, it would be
more accurate to show the real appearance of inclusions rather
than using symbols to substitute for the inclusions. There is
a high demand in the gemological industry to replace manual
diamond clarity evaluation methods with an automated system.

In this paper I have tried to make a Deep learning model
which will find these inclusions and comment on the overall
purity of the diamond
